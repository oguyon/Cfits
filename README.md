# Image analysis tools - full development package 

## Overview

Set of image processing tools and functions accessible through a command line interface (CLI). Holds images in RAM, with image stream support (shared memory with low-latency IPC support).


Written in C.
The main is a command line interface (CLI). Source code is in CLIcore.c and CLIcore.h.
Key data structures (such as the image data structure) are declared in CLIcore.h.


## Downloading and installing 

You can clone the repository, or download the latest .tar.gz distribution.



The source code follows the standard GNU build process. On linux :

	autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make
	make install

On OS X you need to use gcc-mp-5 for opemMP:

	./configure "CC=/opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-5" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/malloc/ -I/opt/local/include/readline" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib/"
(Replace "/opt/local/" is the location of your installed libraries. )
    make
    make install

## Libraries

The following libraries are used:

- libtool
- automake
- readline, for reading the command line input
- ncurses-dev
- flex, for parsing the command line input
- bison, to interpret the command line input
- fftw, for performing Fourier Transforms
- gsl, for math functions and tools
- fitsio, for reading and writing FITS image files
- CUDA, CuBLAS, MAGMA for GPU acceleration (optional)

If you use NVIDIA GPUs, install cuda and magma libraries, and add "--enable-cuda and --enable-magma" options to the configure command.



## Getting Started

All functions are accessible from the command line interface (CLI). Enter the CLI and type "help" for instructions.
